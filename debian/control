 Framework Integration is a set of plugins responsible
 for better integration of Qt applications when running

 various settings from the KDE Plasma Workspace, providing a
 consistent user experience. For example, this will ensure a
 consistent single-click or double-click activation setting,
 and the use of standard themed icons.
